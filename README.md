**Analysis of Clustering Algorithms on Customer Data**

This project talks is mainly about how data can can be clusterd based on customers data. I have used K Means, K Medoids, Hireracial clusting Algorithms to analyse the dataset. The dataset is more used to find out the behaviour of the people. The dataset has the attributes like 'ID', 'Gender', 'Ever_Married', 'Age', 'Graduated', 'Profession','Work_Experience', 'Spending_Score', 'Family_Size', 'Var_1', Segmentation'. This dataset is multiclassed data which we are using dimentionality reduction techiniques to reduce the data and plot scatter plot for better visualizatation.
In order to check, which clustering algorithms performs we must use an **Silhouette Scores**. Silhouette Scores is a metics used to calculate the goodness of the Clustering Techniques. Here we can able to see the cluster seperately and then there is a comparison of the all the three Algorithm's. 

The flow of the Algorithm is given below:
